Calculation of the following fields:
1.	Average Customer Lifetime Value:
Monthly Subscription fee * Gross Margin / Monthly Churn Rate
= 30% * 60%/20% = £90

2.	Estimated Ad Budget (Based on CAC):

Target Customers to Acquire * Cost Per Acquisition (CAC)

= 1000 * 330 = £330,000

3.	Required Impression & Ad Budget:

Required Clicks = Target Customers to Acquire/Projected Conversion Rate
= 1000/5% = 20,000 Required Clicks

Required Impressions = Required Clicks/Projected CTR
= 20,000/2% = 1,000,000
4.	Ad Budget (Based on CPM):
Required Impressions * CPM/1000
= 1,000,000 * 10/1000 = £10,000
